	//   output. This is because counting the imports during the apply is tricky
	//   and we need to use the hooks to get this information back. Currently,
	//   there is a PostImportState function on the hooks. This is almost
	//   certainly not being called in the right place for plannable import
	//   (since this hasn't been implemented yet).
	//
	//   We should absolutely fix this before we launch to alpha, but we can't
	//   do it right now. So we have implemented as much as we can (the plan)
	//   and will revisit this alongside the concrete implementation of the
	//   Terraform graph when we can concretely place the hook in the right
	//   place, introduce a new one, or modify an existing one.
